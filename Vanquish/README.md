</p>

Vanquish is a Kali Linux based Enumeration Orchestrator built in Python.  Vanquish leverages the opensource enumeration tools on Kali to perform multiple active information gathering phases. The results of each phase are fed into the next phase to identify vulnerabilities that could be leveraged for a remote shell.

## Vanquish Features
So what is so special about Vanquish compared to other enumeration scripts?

1.	**Multi-threaded** – Runs multiple commands and scans multiple hosts simultaneously.
2.	**Configurable** – All commands are configured in a separate .ini file for ease of adjustment
3.	**Multiphase** – Optimized to run the fastest enumeration commands first in order to get actionable results as quickly as possible.
4.	**Intelligent** – Feeds the findings from one phase into the next in order to uncover deeper vulnerabilities.
5.	**Modular** – New attack plans and commands configurations can be easily built for fit for purpose enumeration orchestration.

## Getting Started

Vanquish can be installed on Kali Linux using the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/frizb/Vanquish
    cd Vanquish
    python Vanquish2.py -install
    vanquish --help

Once Vanquish is installed you can scan hosts by leveraging the best of breed Kali Linux tools:

    echo 192.168.126.133 >> test.txt
    vanquish -hostFile test.txt -logging
    echo review the results!
    cd test
    cd 192_168_126_133
    ls -la

## What Kali Tools does Vanquish leverage?
| NMap | Hydra | Nikto | Metasploit |
| Gobuster | Dirb | Exploitdb | Nbtscan |
| Ntpq | Enum4linux | Smbclient | Rpcclient |
| Onesixtyone | Sslscan | Sslyze | Snmpwalk |

## Running Vanquish

- **CTRL + C**

    CTRL + C to exit an enumeration phase and skip to the next phase (helpful if a command is taking too long)
    Vanquish will skip running a command again if it sees that the output files already exist.
    If you want to re-execute a command, delete the output files (.txt,.xml,.nmap etc.) and run Vanquish again.

- **CTRL + Z**

    CTRL + Z to exit Vanquish.
    
- **Resume Mode**

    Vanquish will skip running a command again if it sees that the output files already exist.

- **Re-run an enumeration command**

    If you want to re-execute a command, delete the output files (.txt,.xml,.nmap etc.) and run Vanquish again.
